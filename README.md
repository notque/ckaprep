## üõ† Pre-requisites

Time is a big factor, you have **3 hours** to finish **24 questions**. That's **7.5 minutes per question** and they do get progressively harder, so no wasting time on the easier questions. If you‚Äôre spending more than 7 mins on questions worth only one or two percent (each question does tell you the percentage it is worth), move on. You won't finish otherwise.

You need to be very comfortable with the following tools, so that you are not wasting time on non task orientated goals.

### tmux

You only get one console, tmux and screen area allowed. This will allow you to split your single console into multiple windows. ie one master, two nodes. Try and use it in your daily workflow to get comfortable with the default settings.

- [ ] **Perform tmux deepdive** - [https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/tmux](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/tmux) - This course teaches you about tmux's pane and window management, session management, copy-paste, and more. 

### vi

- [ ] **Perform Onramp to Vim** - [https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/onramp-to-vim](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/onramp-to-vim) - Get up and running with the world's best text editor. No Vim experience is required, but you'll be productive in no time (and blazing-fast, soon).

### kubectl

- [ ] Memorise **kubectl Cheat Sheet** and play - [https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/) - This page is an overview of the kubectl command. **NOTE:** This page can be referenced with your one other available tab.

These aliases will help save the precious time you have. Use these during your studies, so you are used to them on the day.

```sh
alias kc='kubectl'
alias kgp='kubectl get pods'
alias kgs='kubectl get svc'
alias kgc='kubectl get componentstatuses'
alias kctx='kubectl config current-context'
alias kcon='kubectl config use-context'
alias kgc='kubectl config get-context'
```

### openssl/cfssl

- [ ] Memorise **OpenSSL command cheatsheet** and play - [https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/openssl-command-cheatsheet-b441be1e8c4a/](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/openssl-command-cheatsheet-b441be1e8c4a/) - When it comes to security-related tasks, like generating keys, CSRs, certificates, calculating digests, debugging TLS connections and other tasks related to PKI and HTTPS, you‚Äôd most likely end up using the OpenSSL tool.


## üéØ Practice Test

This following here is great for a testing scenario. It gives you 24 questions to answer, a terminal, and a timer. You bring the cluster and kube config. It's highly suggest running through this to get comfortable with the test environment as this is the best replica for the test environment out there. It uses the same terminal emulator that the test uses, [https://github.com/liftoff/GateOne](https://github.com/liftoff/GateOne).

- [ ] Do **github.com/arush-sal/cka-practice-environment** - [https://github.com/arush-sal/cka-practice-environment](https://github.com/arush-sal/cka-practice-environment) - A sample lab test environment to help in preparation of CKA certification.

- [ ] Do **github.com/stretchcloud/cka-lab-practice** - [https://github.com/stretchcloud/cka-lab-practice](https://github.com/stretchcloud/cka-lab-practice) - A set of exercises that will help you to prepare for the Certified Kubernetes Administrator exam.
